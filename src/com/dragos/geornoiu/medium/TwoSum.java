     * 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/
     *
     * <p>
     * Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers
     * such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2]
     * where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
     * <p>
     * Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of
     * length 2.
     * <p>
     * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
     * <p>
     * Your solution must use only constant extra space.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
     * Output: [1,2]
     * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
     * Output: [1,3]
     * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
     * Example 3:
     * <p>
     * Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
     * Output: [1,2]
     * Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
     * -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
     * numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     * -1000 <= target <= 1000
     * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
