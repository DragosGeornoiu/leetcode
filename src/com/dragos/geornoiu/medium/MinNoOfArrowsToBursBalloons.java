     * 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/
     * <p>
     * There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are
     * represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal
     * diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
     * <p>
     * Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis.
     * A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the
     * number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
     * <p>
     * Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
     * - Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
     * - Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
     * <p>
     * Example 2:
     * Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
     * <p>
     * Example 3:
     * Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
     * - Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
     * - Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * 1 <= points.length <= 105
     * points[i].length == 2
     * -2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1

    // Approach was to go trough the intervals of each baloon and if I find a position at which the current interval

    // intervals.
    //
    // Issue 1: Did not realize that I needed to have the initial array sorted as the following input would give an
    // extra value:
    // int[][] input4 = new int[][]{{3, 9}, {7, 12}, {3, 8}, {6, 8}, {9, 10}, {2, 9}, {0, 9}, {3, 9}, {0, 6}, {2, 8}};

    //      the other an adaptation of MergeSort named Timsort. Both have a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is
